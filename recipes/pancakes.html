    <h2>Homemade Pancakes</h2>
    <p>Easy, classic, homemade Pancakes! These are fluffy, tender, buttery, golden brown, and lightly sweet – everything
        a pancake should be. Way better than the packaged mix and made with everyday staple ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 cups (189g) all-purpose flour (preferably unbleached), scoop and level to measure</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp (25g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp butter, melted (unsalted or salted is fine)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tsp plain vinegar or lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and
            salt for 20 seconds. Make a well in center of flour mixture, set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Mix wet ingredients: In a separate medium mixing bowl or large liquid measuring cup whisk together milk,
            egg, butter, vinegar, and lemon juice.
        </li>
        <li>Combine mixtures: Pour milk mixture into well in flour mixture. Whisk just to blend, batter should be
            slightly lumpy. Let batter rest a few minutes to fluff up.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat GRIDDLE: Preheat an electric griddle to 350 – 375 degrees depending on how hot your griddle gets. Or
            STOVETOP: Or you can heat a non-stick skillet over medium to medium-high heat on the stovetop.
        </li>
        <li>Pour batter in portions onto griddle: Grease griddle (with non-stick cooking spray or a little butter – but
            be quick if using butter). Pour about 1/3 cup batter at a time onto griddle. Spread batter out slightly if
            thick (rounds should be about 4 1/2-inches).
        </li>
        <li>Cook until golden brown on each side: Let cook until golden brown on bottom and bubbles appear on top
            surface, about 1 minute. Flip and cook opposite side until browned on bottom.
        </li>
        <li>Top and serve: Serve warm with topping of choice.</li>
    </ol>
